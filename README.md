Implement an event store / write database in MongoDB.

Create a read database in MS SQL.

Apply event versioning.

Implement optimistic concurrency control.

Produce events to Apache Kafka.

Consume events from Apache Kafka to populate and alter records in the read database.

Replay the event store and recreate the state of the aggregate.

Separate read and write concerns.
